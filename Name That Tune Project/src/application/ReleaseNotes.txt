Release Notes - Version: 0.2.0-alpha (Alpha 2.0)
Date Written/Updated: 6/30/2023
Written By: Brandon Green (Software Developer)

New Features:

MAJOR FEATURE(S):
-Tiebreaker Mode is now fully functional. It has been enabled by default and will need to be
switched off manually by the user during the setup of each game. It is recommended to keep it 
enabled, as it can be bypassed via the new 'Tie Detected' screen by pressing the 'No' button. 

MINOR FEATURE(S):
-Release Info Screen has been redesigned and a couple minor features were added. There are 3 
notable new features:
1. A button was added that will open the release notes text file in the Github Repo. This is a
temporary solution until I can fix a last minute bug that was causing the text file to not open
locally from the jar file (though it did work in my working dev build in Eclipse IDE). This will
take some time to figure out how to resolve, but was not worth delaying this release over. So this
workaround should suffice for now. *
2. A hyperlink was added that when clicked will open the Github Repository for this project in the
user's default web browser.*
3. A 'Report A Bug' hyperlink was added that will open the 'Issues' page of the Github Repo in the
user's default web browser.* This will allow the user to easily view any reported bugs/issues with
the software and also allow them to report a new issue or bug that hasn't been reported so that I
can work on fixing them in a future version.

*It is worth noting the above features have a limitation that may result in them not working in all
systems. Notably any system that doesn't support the 'Desktop' API of Java (in some cases Linux
may not support it). If your system is not compatible with the feature an error message will be 
displayed on the screen and the above 3 features will not work.*

-Credits screen has been partially completed to add Software Developer name and the name(s) of any
Alpha testers who have been providing user end testing and feedback. Will finish fine tuning layout
and adding things to it in the next pre-release. 


Improvements:

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS:
-The results list on the results page has been improved to show 1 of 3 possible labels next to 
winning or tied player(s):
1. (Winner) - Added next to a winning player if a player wins the game outright without needing
to break a tie. 
2. (Winner Via Tiebreaker) - Added next to a winning player if the results of the main round ended
in a tie and the player won the tiebreaker round. 
3. (Tied) - Added next to any players who are tied for 1st place and tiebreaker mode was either
disabled or bypassed. This label has existed since the 1st ever pre-release version of
the software and isn't really new.

-The song ListView on the results screen has been resized to fit 6 songs in the list without
needing to scroll. This was done to accomodate a tiebreaker song in a game where 5 songs were
used in the main game. Additionally the label (Tiebreaker) will be added to the song played in 
the tiebreaker round. This will allow the tiebreaker song to be differentiated from those in the
main round of the game.

-The 'Save Results' (disabled) and 'Return To Main Menu' buttons on the results screen have been
properly centered with page now. They were slightly off centered to the left in previous versions.


Bug Fixes:
-Fixed a bug that only existed in version 0.1.1-alpha (Alpha 1.0) where it was possible to add a
blank/empty song to the song list if the user added a song to the list and did not type in any
input to the song name and/or artist box before clicking the add button again. This bug ironically 
was caused by a bug fix that was done in the previous version to prevent this very thing. 
The bug was caused by the 'Add' button not disabling after a song was added the 1st time. The fix
for the issue was simple: just disable the button after it is pressed and only have it enabled when
there is valid input in the song name textfield (aka not empty).


Code Changes/Improvements (for folks with coding knowledge):
-Finished data structure changes that were started in the previous version (0.1.1-alpha), these
changes overhauled the complicated and confusing mess of arrays, hashmaps and arraylists used
to keep track of the song name/artist and player names and scores. The data structure has been
optimized to now use proper OOP principles by replacing all data structures used in version 
0.1.0-alpha with 3 ArrayLists: 1 Arraylist containing 'Song' objects, 1 ArrayList containing 
'Player' objects and a 3rd ArrayList containing Strings that is used by the results page to add
the (Winner) or (Tied) labels to players. These changes have greatly improved code readibility and
maintainablility and should make it easier to add new features as development continues. All code 
that called or used the old data structures have been removed or modified to use the new
structures instead. 

-Added Javadoc comments to several methods that were previously missing them. Any methods I missed
will be fully commented by the next pre-release version, but I think I got them all.

-Reformatted a lot of the code in the ResultsController class to break up what was becoming a 
confusing, complicated 'monster' method. Now the methods handling the generation of the results
list have been broken up into 3 methods, 1 main method and 2 helper methods (tho only 1 will be 
used, which one depends on whether Tiebreaker Mode is enabled or disabled):
1. resultsGenerator() - Main method (previously was named 'sortScores()'), it checks whether
Tiebreaker mode is set to on or off and calls the appriorate helper method depending on the result.
2. tieBreakerOffGenerator(position) - Helper method called if tiebreaker mode is off.
3. tieBreakerOnGenerator(position) - Helper method called if tiebreaker mode is on. 

-Removed empty classes that I had added previously in preparation for Tiebreaker mode but ended up
not needing. 

-Cleaned up the code to remove any unneeded/old code that was commented out in a previous version
and will definitely no longer be needed. Only code that could be useful in the future for either
troubleshooting of future bugs or during the development of new features still remain. The code is
much neater and easier to read now. 

-I will be continuing to improve code structure and readibility in any areas that may need it as
I continue to work on the software. That being said, I am happy with the new code structure and
readbility improvements, it has come a long way from the 1st pre-release version and even the
previous version. 

-The next thing on the to do list for the next pre-release version will be patching any new bugs
that are reported for this version, especially any relating to the new Tiebreaker Mode feature. 
Additionally I will likely make some minor tweaks and improvements to Tiebreaker Mode based on 
user end testing and using the software in a live game of Name That Tune where I get the best
feedback. After Tiebreaker Mode is fully polished up and optimized as best as it can be, I will
be moving my attention to the 'Save Results' feature which will be the focus of the next major
pre-release version 0.3.0-alpha (Alpha 3.0).
