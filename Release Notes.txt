Release Notes - Version: 0.1.1-alpha (Alpha 1.1)

Bug Fixes:

-Bug where users would have to hit enter after typing in the number of songs on Game Setup Screen fixed. Similarly the same issue on the Song Info Setup Screen has been also been fixed. Essentially all input validation checks should now occur real time as the user types and program responds accordingly with either displaying messages or enabling or disabling buttons.

-Bug that permitted duplicate songs and player names has been fixed. When the add button is pressed on either Song Info Setup Screen or Player Info Setup Screen it performs a case insensitive check for duplicates and will display an error message to the user (as well as not add the input to list) if duplicates are found. It should be noted that Songs are considered a duplicate if a song with BOTH the same name and artist (regardless of letter case) is found in the list. A song with the same name as one already in the list but with a different artist is not considered a duplicate.

-Fixed a previously unreported bug that allowed users to click the 'Finish' button to generate the results of a game without adding points to ANY user (all users have 0 points). The 'Finish' button is now disabled until one of the following buttons is pressed: Song Only, Artist Only, Both. This will ensure that at least 1 player has at least 1 point before results can be generated.

Improvements: 

GUI/User Experience Improvements:

-Song numbers are now stored along with artist name and song numbers will now be displayed before the song name on every screen where the song list is displayed (including the Song Info Screen as they are being added). Additionally the label showing currently selected song on the 'Set Player Scores Screen' will now display the song number before the name. This latter change (the label showing number change) is purely for experimention and may be changed back to just displaying user name based on user feedback as development continues.

Source Code Improvements:

-New Player and Song classes added with nessecary instance variables and setter/getter methods and other methods as nessecary for checking for equality.

-Begun the process of converting the various arrays and hashmap lists that were previously used in the original prototype version (Pre-Alpha 1.0 or Alpha 1.0 [0.1.0-alpha] as it is now referred to) over 2 simple Arraylists. 1 Arraylist of type 'Song' to store song information and 1 Arraylist of type 'Player' to store player information. The previously used arrays and hashmaps are still intact for the moment and are used to generate the results in order to maintain backwards compatibility. They should be fully removed within the next 2 versions hopefully. 

-Redid the 'Global Values' class. Changed all variables to final variables, changed their variable names to use all caps seperated by a underscore (as per convetion for final variables). Additionally these variables were made private instead of public and public getter methods for each one were made. These were all things that I should have done from the get go but for reasons I can not remember were not. Global Values class now follows proper encapsulation etiquette. The old variables as they were set before really are no longer needed as I changed everything over in all over classes to use the new getter methods. For the sake of sanity I have kept them in the code but commented out until next version.

-Begun the process of writing comments for those methods that didn't have them and needed them. Also changed the format of some comments to make them Javadoc comments. I will continue to work on improving comments throughout the entire source code over the next couple versions (plus as new things are added to the project).

-Revised the Version System to follow the conventions of Semantic Versioning (2.0.0). Abandoned the 'Pre-Alpha' phase as that seemed to be the incorrect naming for it and will be referring to all pre-Beta versions as Alpha from here on. There will be 2 ways that versions will be shown: 0.X.X-alpha (for all pre-release Alpha versions) or Alpha X.X. For example the current version as of this pre-release is Alpha 1.1 or 0.1.1-alpha as it is officially known. Both versions will be used for now and will decide later on how best to display to users. It should be noted as well that from now on, version Pre-Alpha 1.0 will be referred to as Alpha 1.0 or the official version number of 0.1.0-alpha.
