Release Notes - Version: 0.4.0-alpha

New Features:

MAJOR FEATURE(S):
-Song List Generator - A feature that allows the user to generate and save a stand alone song list to a text file. This file can then be used to import the generated song list during the setup
of a future game (more details in the description of the import feature below).

-Song List Importing - This feature allows a song list to be imported from a text file that was created using either the Song List Generator or the general 'Save' feature. The intent of this
feature is to make the setup of a new game faster and more convenient by allowing users to import previously saved song lists rather than having to manually input each song manually during
setup.

Song List Importing Feature Notes:
-This feature is still considered experimental, while I have tested and debugged it as thoroughly as I can during development, I cannot guarantee it will be 100% accurate in all import cases.
-The software will automatically skip a song during the import process if it detects formatting errors that make it unable to process the data correctly.
-This feature is designed to import song lists from a text file that was formatted and generated by the software itself. Attempting to import a song list from a file that was not generated by
the software or that has been manually edited by the user may lead to unpredictable results (including the software itself potentially crashing) during the import process.
-The software will automatically detect if a song has been labeled as the tiebreaker song and will handle it differently than other songs. Tiebreaker songs are processed as follows:
1. The song will automatically and silently be set as the Tiebreaker song for the current game. This means the user will not be prompted to enter a tiebreaker song during the tiebreaking process.
2. The tiebreaker song will NOT be displayed in the song list at any point except the final results screen (and even then only if a tiebreaker is used).
3. The successful import of the tiebreaker song is NOT counted in the number of successfully imported songs displayed to the user.
-TLDR is that if you do not see the tiebreaker song displayed in the song list after the import process is complete, that does not mean it was not successfully imported. The process is intentionally
invisible to the user. The first time the user will see the imported tiebreaker song is during the tie breaker process.


MINOR FEATURE(S):
-No minor features were added in this version.

Improvements:

MINOR IMPROVEMENT(S):
-When a game is saved by the user, the scoring history for the game will now be saved to the generated text file as well. This will allow users to have detailed information on what songs
players got correct in order to get the final score they did. Users can then use this information to create better song lists for future games based on how well they performed in previous
games.

Please note: For now, there is no way to exclude the scoring history from saved game files. I am considering adding the ability for users to choose whether to save it with
the game results or not. I may add it to a future version of the software based on user feedback.

BUG FIXES:
-Fixed a bug in the textbox for entering the number of songs, it would select the 'Continue' button after a single valid digit was entered. This was ironically due to a previous bug fix I 
implemented last version. I have re-done the logic for the number of songs TextBox so that now the maximum number of characters that can be typed is 2. Additionally the continue button 
is only auto selected when 2 valid digits are entered. I am satisfied that new logic and functionality is as good as it can get.

Code Changes/Improvements (for technical users):
-New 'import' class created, with some methods written for handling song list importing. Method stubs for other methods that will be written during the next version have been created as well.
-Rewrote comments for a couple methods in various classes to use Javadoc format.
-Some minor code refactoring was done to make the development of features in the next few versions easier. Old code was commented out but left unchanged, if any undiscovered bugs pop up
I will restore the code as needed. Old code will be removed over the next couple versions once I am confident it is no longer needed.
-Code logic written into TieBreakerMode to skip manual entry of Tiebreaker song if one was imported through a song list.
-Very minor improvement to scoring history logic was done, it is now slightly shorter. Additionally it now displays 'Song Only' or 'Artist Only' if either of those buttons are pressed.
-The logic for the one point button handler in set player scores was improved to be able to detect which button called it.

That is everything for this version, my apologies for how long it took to release another version this year. I started working on this version at
 the end of June/early July and it took awhile
due to expanding the scope of the update a couple times. I plan to start releasing 'bigger' versions with more features and changes going forward. 
This should hopefully start getting the software ready for the first Beta version hopefully by the end of 2025 at the latest.
