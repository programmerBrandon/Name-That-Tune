Release Notes - Version: 0.3.1-alpha

New Features:

MAJOR FEATURE(S):
-No major features added during this release.

MINOR FEATURE(S):
-Added the ability to edit song and player info while on either song setup screen or player setup screen. After a song or player is added to the list, the user can select a song or player on the list to display an edit button.

-Added a scoring history on the scoring screen that allows the user to see a complete history of scoring actions. It will show the user the number of points added, the player it was added to and for what song it was added for. This solves a major flaw of the program where it was easy to lose track of what points were applied to which player for which songs. 

-In addition to the scoring history feature described above, I have also added an undo feature that allows the user to undo any scoring action that was previously done by selecting the action from the scoring history list and then pressing the undo button. When a scoring action is undone, the points that were added during that action will be removed from the appriopriate player and that action will be removed from the scoring history. By default the most recent scoring action performed will be auto selected on the history list so that a scoring mistake that gets caught immediately can be quickly undo by simply pressing the undo button. 

Improvements:

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS:
-Added a tabbed layout for instructions on song setup, player setup and scoring screens. This allows for instructions to be broken up into categories for different features on the screen. On the scoring screen the tabbed layout allows for the user to toggle between the instructions and the new scoring history feature.

-Rewrote the instructions for the song and player setup screens to make them simpler and easier to read. Simple instructions on using the new edit feature on both screens have also been added.


Bug Fixes:
-Fixed a bug that made it so you couldn't simply press enter to move to the next screen after entering the number of songs on the first game setup screen.

Code Changes/Improvements (for technical users):
-Refactored the code in the SetPlayerScoresController, SongInfoSetupController and PlayerInfoSetupController java files. As part of this process some old code that was commented out from previous versions were removed. Additionally I rewrote some code into helper functions in order to reduce the number of 'monster functions' and improve code maintainibility longterm.

-Added javadoc comments to various functions were missing them and also rewrote some outdated comments to reflect recent code changes.

-Added new event listeners to temporary Observable lists used throughout the program so that any changes made to them will automatically update the ListViews that show the data to the user. This has greatly reduced redunant code in several places and also allowed for easier implementation of the new edit and undo features.

While making this version I was able to clean up and refactor code in several files that really needed it. The source code is now much cleaner and structured significantly better than in the first couple pre-release versions. I am hoping to have it completely refactored by the first Beta version.
